Nikema's Notes on the [Intro to Rust workshop](https://ti.to/egghead-live-online-events/a-tour-of-rust-with-pascal-precht-2020-01-23/)

I used GitHub issues and projects to organize my notes. The [Wiki](https://github.com/prophen/intro-to-rust/wiki) on this repo puts the notes in lesson order.

I also had a [few quick notes](https://github.com/prophen/intro-to-rust/projects/1#column-7773323) and [links from the chat](https://github.com/prophen/intro-to-rust/projects/1#column-7773307) in the repo Project
